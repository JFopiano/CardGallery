# A/B Test Name: Signup/Sign In 1 or 2 screens
## User Story Number: Is a task under US1 (Account Creation)
## Metrics: Adoption
## Hypothesis: 
- The problem we are trying to solve is how we can best reach our customers to download and register for our app
- For our customers, if we have an app that is difficult to register an account for it could deter customers form wanting to use our product before they get started
- To elaborate, customers may get frustrated when there are too many pages and forums to create an account
- For our main focus we are attempting to figure out how many screens are needed to best reach our customers to increase our adoption rate
- For our hypothesis we can make a snack bar/pop up page to have the users chose their preferences versus having it on a seperate page
## Experiment: We will have half of our users have access to the pop up page and half of our users have access to the seperate page for user preferences. This way we will be able to track our adoption rate between the two groups. With our Firebase analytics we will be able to track how many users use our app versus how many users actually create an account to increase our adoption rate.
## Variations: One variation will be our app with a separate page for user preferences (which kinds of cards they are intersted in) versus a pop up page with those same preferences.
