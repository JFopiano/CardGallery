# Our Pledge
We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, 
regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, 
education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

# Our Standards
Decisions will be made by group consensus. Any disagreements among group members will be resolved in a civil manner.

Tasks will be assigned with each new sprint. Group members may choose which tasks they would like to complete if they 
1) Have a specific interest in that particular aspect of the project and
2) Have gotten approval from the other members. Group members will be expected to fulfill their tasks on schedule.
   Members who are unable to complete their assigned tasks on time may be confronted by other team member(s) or the professor/TA to try and remedy the situation.

All group members must contribute equally during meetings. Members must be mindful and respectful of others when they are speaking and should not interrupt each other to ensure meetings run smoothly. 
No one member should take center stage for most of the meeting; it is important to allow everyone a chance to speak and contribute to the conversation. 
All members are expected to give their full attention in each meeting. Phones or other distractions must be away.

Meetings will be held in-person or over Discord. Exact times/locations will vary depending on the circumstances, but will be decided upon depending on the availability of all group members. 
If someone cannot attend a meeting, whether due to last-minute emergencies or an alteration to their schedule, the meeting may be postponed, rescheduled, or in circumstances where the meeting cannot be delayed further, 
the group will proceed without the missing member(s), who will be responsible for catching up on what they missed.

Every member is working around and within their own busy schedule to hold and join meetings, so when a meeting time is established and mutually agreed upon, attendance and promptness are expected. 
If a member is routinely late to or absent from meetings, another group member(s), or in more extreme cases, the professor or TA, may confront them and work to find a solution going forward. 

Members are encouraged to take notes on what is discussed and assigned in each meeting. 

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:
- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
